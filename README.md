Abstract
This report is all about the design, implementation, and evaluation of a machine learning
classifier used for differentiating between the class of documents related to Sports and
Politics. We inspected three distinct feature representation techniques—Bag of Words
(BoW), TF-IDF, and N-grams—and calculated their performance across three supervised
machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVM).From the experimental results which I accquired during this process,I can
comment that Naive Bayes with TFIDF feature extraction tool has achieved a highest
accuracy of 95.78%
